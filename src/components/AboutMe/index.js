                        <p>Iâ€™m Jason Matthew, a Full Stack developer from Brisbane Australia.</p>
                        <p>I have been designing and developing websites for the past 7 years. Starting as a freelancer working with start-ups and local businesses. I love coding and learning about the latest trends. With a particular focus on the current JavaScript ecosystem, and a traditional knowledge of PHP through WordPress and MVC frameworks like SilverStripe, Code Ignitor and Laravel.</p>

                        <p>I am a avid learner and I put a high priority on this attending local meetups whenever possible, while also seeking learning through online courses and personal projects.</p>
                        <p>When outside of work I enjoy Learning including running two servers at home to experience more server architecture, networks and deployment methods.</p>
                        <p>I also strive to remain active as fitness is a passion of mine participating in weekly 5km parkrun events, while remaining active through gym and running throughout the week. </p>
